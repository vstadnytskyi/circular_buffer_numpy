Introduction
------------

Buffers are widely used in the computer architecture to allow efficient data storage, handling and later retrieval.

This project uses numpy array data structures to provide a fast and flexible data handling for streams of data. It is common to have a data acquisition unit that measures at a certain rate. The data from the internal buffer need to be read efficiently and should be available to other programs\devices at later time. The numpy array data structure in Python allows to preallocate memory at the initialization and the data handling from now on is extremely efficient.

Queue
-----

Queue is an abstract data type where data is maintained in a sequence and can be modified by addition and removal of the entries. By convention, the end of the sequence at which elements are added is called the back, tail, or rear of the queue, and the end at which elements are removed is called the head or front of the queue, analogously to the words used when people line up to wait for goods or services. (read more https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)). The implementation of the Queue in this library uses underlying numpy array structure to insure fast and reliable data addition and removal from the queue.

Definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In this section, we describe definitions of variables and their meaning.

* 'rear' is a pointer at current next available cell to enqueue.

* 'length' the number of entries in the queue.

* 'data_shape' - the shape of the one data entry.

* 'shape' - shape of the entire available queue space.

Circular Buffer
---------------


Shape
-----

The shape of the circular buffer and queue objects follows the numpy convention. The first element in the shape (fast axis) defines the circular length of the buffer and the rest define the dimensionality of the data stored.

Example:
the shape circular buffer with the shape = (100,2,2) has the length of 100 and datapoint_shape of (2,2)
